abstract = {As the number of processes and resources increases within a computer system, does the probability of that system's being in deadlock increase or decrease? This paper introduces Probabilistic Automata as a model of computer systems. This allows investigation of the above question for various scheduling algorithms. A theorem is proven which indicates that, within the types of systems considered, the probability of deadlock increases.},

abstract = {Driven by the need for ultra-low latency, high throughput and low CPU overhead, Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is being deployed by many cloud providers. To deploy RDMA in Ethernet networks, Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) must be used. PFC, however, makes Ethernet networks prone to deadlocks. Prior work on deadlock avoidance has focused on {em necessary} condition for deadlock formation, which leads to rather onerous and expensive solutions for deadlock avoidance. In this paper, we investigate {em sufficient} conditions for deadlock formation, conjecturing that avoiding {em sufficient} conditions might be less onerous.},

abstract = {Deadlock has been widely studied in many fields of computer science, notably in communications, database, and operating systems. Perhaps because (at least one state called) deadlock is tractable, there exists extensive literature on the subject. Deadlock was apparently decisively defined over thirty years ago, with its characteristics and handlers. Yet, much of the literature remains inconsistent in its treatment of this anomaly.A more precise definition is clearly needed to distinguish between the different states that are termed deadlock. A classification of dead states is required to distinguish the causes and appropriate handlers for each. We introduce a model to structure our research.},
